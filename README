This is an XMPP library for Haskell.  Build it with:

  runhaskell Setup.hs configure
  runhaskell Setup.hs build

Build the documentation with:

  runhaskell Setup.hs haddock

The documentation is also available on the web page.

This distribution also contains a werewolf bot, which plays a silly
game with chat room participants.  Create a Jabber account for it, and
run it with:

  werewolf user@example.com

Then you can talk it into entering a chat room and playing the game;
the bot is designed to be self-documenting.  At least four players are
needed.
